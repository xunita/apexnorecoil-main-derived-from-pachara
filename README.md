## 29/12/2022 

* Added the hyde.dll code to hide the process in task manager (NoRecoilScript & NoRecoilScript-Old-From-PACHARA).
* Replace the r99 pattern with car since I use it a lot (NoRecoilScript).
* Replaced the R301 pattern by another pattern more accurate than the last one (NoRecoilScript).
